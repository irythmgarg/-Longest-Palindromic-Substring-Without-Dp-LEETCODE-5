Explanation:
Palindrome Helper Function:

This function checks if a given substring of s (from index i to j) is a palindrome.
It uses a two-pointer technique, where i starts from the beginning of the substring and j starts from the end.
If at any point the characters s[i] and s[j] don't match, it returns false. Otherwise, it continues to move i forward and j backward until they cross each other.
If the loop completes, the substring is a palindrome, and the function returns true.
Main Function:

The function longestPalindrome finds the longest palindromic substring by iterating through all possible substrings of s (using two nested loops).
For each substring defined by indices i and j, it checks if the substring is a palindrome using the Palindrome helper function.
If it finds a palindrome and its length is greater than the current maxLength, it updates maxLength and the start index.
Finally, the function returns the longest palindromic substring using substr(start, maxLength).
Time Complexity:
Outer Loop (i):

The outer loop runs n times, where n is the length of the string s.
Inner Loop (j):

The inner loop runs from i to n, so for each value of i, the number of iterations of j is (n - i).
Palindrome Check:

The Palindrome function checks if a substring from i to j is a palindrome. In the worst case, it compares each pair of characters in the substring, which takes O(n) time.
Overall Time Complexity:

The time complexity for checking each substring is O(n), and the number of substrings is O(n^2) (due to the nested loops).
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the solution is O(n^3), where n is the length of the string.
Space Complexity:
Auxiliary Space:

The space complexity is mainly determined by the space used by the Palindrome function for checking substrings.
The function uses only a few variables (i and j) and does not allocate extra space proportional to the input size.
Hence, the auxiliary space complexity is O(1).
Final Space Complexity:

The space complexity is O(1) as no extra space is used for storing results other than variables for indices and substring lengths.
Optimizing Time Complexity:
This approach has a cubic time complexity due to checking all substrings. There are more efficient algorithms to solve the longest palindromic substring problem:

Dynamic Programming: This can reduce the time complexity to O(n^2).
Expand Around Center: This can reduce the time complexity to O(n^2) and space complexity to O(1).
Manacherâ€™s Algorithm: This can solve the problem in O(n) time.
